Automated testing tooling is hard to setup and deploy.
This repo has example flows of web and mobile automated testing.


* [selenium](https://www.seleniumhq.org/) Web Browser automation control
* [appium](http://appium.io/) Android and iOS automation control
* [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) Extendible python testing framework
    * [selenium-python](http://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/)
    * [appium:python-client](https://github.com/appium/python-client)
    * [pytest-selenium](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-selenium/blob/master/docs/user_guide.rst)
    * [pytest-appium](https://github.com/calaldees/pytest-appium)
* [docker](https://www.docker.com/)
    * docker makes it simpler to setup for local development and easyer to integrate into production build jobs.
